# DSS Computing Bootcamp 2017

This is a 3 hour computing bootcamp for incoming PhD and MS
students to the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University.

The workshop will cover the following topics:

## Introduction to the department computing eco-system

- Account activation and access to departmental servers.
- Discussion of how to responsibly use distributed computing resources.

## Introduction to Reproducible Research

- Recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address, featuring brief discussion of case studies case studies of (lack of) reproducibility gone wrong.
- Identify pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
- The role of documentation, sharing, automation, and organization in making your research more reproducible.
Introducing some tools to solve these problems, specifically R/RStudio/RMarkdown.

## Organizing your project to facilitate Reproducible Research

- Organize projects and folders to enable reproducibility and reusability
- Understand the structure of data files and the importance of documenting all changes made
- Using these practices, create a reproducible project workflow using R/RStudio/RMarkdown.

## Version control

- Introduction to git/GitHub as a version control tool.
- Practice initiating a project directory, making / committing / pushing changes, and creating a pull request to someone else's remote repository.
- Discuss the role of version control in reproducibility of one's own project as well as in collaborative projects.
